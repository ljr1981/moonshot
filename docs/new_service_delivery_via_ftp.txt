SENDING-SIDE
============
The sending-side needs its own NSSM process that watches for a new "setup.exe" ready to be depolyed from a deployment folder. Our recommendation is to give each GitHub project a deployment folder, where one will place new "setup.exe" files together with "deployment.ini" files, which contain the needed information on how and where to deploy.

1. Notice a new "setup.exe" being placed into any "deployment" folder.
2. Using WinSCP, send the new "setup.exe" to the target FTP Server (e.g. FileZilla Server).
3. Move the "setup.exe" file to a "deployed" folder.
4. Rename the file with YYYYMMDDSSSSS, where SSSSS = Seconds-since-midnight

NOTE: We need to determine if we need some form of security beyond that provided by FileZilla?

RECEIVING-SIDE
==============
On the development-side, we produce a new setup.exe installer. That installer contains everything needed to run the particular service EXE contained within it.

The next task is to deploy that setup.exe from the development-side to the production-server-side, shut down the existing service, install the new, and then restart the newly installed service.

1. Notice the receipt of a new "setup.exe" in downloads or received folder.
2. Transfer the "setup.exe" to an installer folder.
3. NSSN-shutdown the existing "service.exe".
4. Run the "setup.exe".
5. NSSM-wrap the new "service.exe".
6. NSSM-run the new "service.exe".
7. Send email/sms confirmation and logging.

This seven-step process needs to be an NSSM service that is running on the production-server-side.

Receipt of the new "setup.exe" will be performed by some instance of an FTP server like FileZilla Server.
