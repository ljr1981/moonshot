In reality (behind the scenes), the blog entries are just JSON text files with Title, Author, Date, and Entry fields in JSON formatted text. The code in Moonshot (see {MS_BLOGS}.content_setup) is really simple and straight forward: Open the `blogs' folder, find any *.json files, read them, parse them, and then post them as <article> text."
